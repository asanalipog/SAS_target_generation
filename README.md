Here our task is to get molecules that have SAS closest to 2.2 value. Algorithms that are used to get result -> Sorting and 2 pointer.

SAS_target_generation.py - Main code
qm8_1000.csv - dataset
fpscores.pkl.gz - Pre-structured model file for determine SAScore
mutate.py - Controls mutation in GA 
crossover.py - Controls crossover in GA 
sascorer.py - Functions for calculate SAScore
